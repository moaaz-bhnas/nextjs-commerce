# Managing customers

When a new customer places an order with your store, their name and information are automatically added to your customer list. A customer profile is created when a customer interacts with your business in any of the following ways:

- signing up for your mailing list or a customer account
- placing an order
- starting an order, but abandoning their checkout

Alternatively, you can add a customer to your store manually.

You can send email messages to individual customers from your Shopify admin, or send discounts and email messages to groups of customers by using [customer segments](/en/manual/customers/customer-segmentation).

## Edit customer profiles

If a customer profile already exists in Shopify, then you can edit the profile from the **Customers** page.

Before you update a customer profile, verify if another staff member is currently making changes to the same profile so that your changes don't conflict.

You can add a note to a customer profile to keep track of special information about the customer. Only staff members of your store can access these notes. These notes aren't visible to customers.

Using [tags](/en/manual/shopify-admin/productivity-tools/using-tags) can help you to organize your customer profile list. You can use tags to label your customers by using descriptive terms or to sort them into categories. For example, if you have important customers, then you can tag those customers as `VIP`. Tags can also be used to create [customer segments](/en/manual/customers/customer-segmentation). Tags are not case sensitive.

#### Note

If you use [customer accounts](/en/manual/customers/customer-accounts/new-customer-accounts), then customers can also [update their own profile name and email address](/en/manual/customers/customer-accounts/new-customer-accounts/customer-experience#updates) from their customer account on your online store.

## Edit customer profiles in bulk

From your Shopify admin, you can use [bulk editing](/en/manual/shopify-admin/productivity-tools/bulk-actions) to edit information for multiple customer profiles at the same time.

You can use bulk editing to edit the **First name**, **Last name**, **Tags**, **Email**, and **Accepts email marketing** fields on customer profiles, and any [_Metafields_](/en/manual/custom-data/metafields) values.

To edit other fields on a customer profile, such as address lines, phone number, or tax exempt status, you need to [edit the customer profile individually](/en/manual/customers/manage-customers#edit-customer-profiles) or [use a CSV file](/en/manual/customers/import-export-customers).

You can select multiple or all customer profiles in the following ways:

- To edit multiple customer profiles, select each customer profile.
- To edit all customer profiles that are listed on the page for a segment or based on a search, select the **Customer name** checkbox. A maximum of 50 customers is listed per page.

## Merging customer profiles

You might have two or more customer profiles that refer to one customer. In this case, you can merge two profiles together, combining them into one profile. Before you complete the merge, you have the opportunity to review and select what information the merged profile will have. The customer ID that remains on the merged profile will be the ID that's associated with the address you select during the merge.

The following information is merged into one profile:

- orders
- draft orders
- addresses
- email address
- phone number
- name
- notes
- tags
- tax settings
- timeline events
- credit cards
- customer accounts
- gift cards
- discounts

If any information from both profiles conflicts, then you can cancel the merge process and adjust the information in each record on the customer profile pages before you proceed with the merge.

#### Note

Orders are permanently associated with the customer account that placed them. You can't move individual orders between customer accounts because the order's email address is used as a unique identifier. This applies even if you modify the order's contact email address. If you need to associate orders with a different customer account, then you can [merge customer profiles](/en/manual/customers/manage-customers#customer-profiles-merge).

### Limitations for merging customer profiles

Before you merge customer profiles, review the following considerations:

- After the profiles are merged, you can't reverse the process.
- If the profiles include notes, then the combined notes must be less than or equal to 5000 characters, including spaces.
- If the profiles include tags, then the combined tags must be less than or equal to 250 tags.
- If the customer is subscribed to email and SMS text marketing in one profile, but not in the other, then the merged profile is subscribed.
- The customer isn't notified when you merge their customer profiles.
- Profiles can't be merged in the following cases:
  - either of the customer profiles has, or has ever had, a subscription contract
  - either of the customer profiles is a B2B customer actively linked to a company, or still linked to past B2B orders

  - either of the customer profiles has a store credit account

## Erase a customer’s personal data

You can request to erase a customer’s personal data and redact your customer’s personal data from Shopify’s records, and from any apps and channels that you’ve installed from your Shopify admin. Shopify only redacts personal information, such as your customer’s name and address.

#### Caution

When a customer profile is deleted, the customer’s personal data, such as their name and address, is also redacted from Shopify's records.

- the customer is the recipient of a scheduled gift card that hasn't been delivered yet
- the customer has ever had a [subscription](/en/manual/products/purchase-options/subscriptions)

## Requirements for US military shipping addresses

Military mailing addresses in the US have a unique format that must be entered in a specific way. If the address is entered incorrectly, then the order might not arrive to the intended recipient. There are three different types of US military address:

- Army/Air Post Office (APO)
- Fleet Post Office (FPO)
- Diplomatic Post Office (DPO)

If you receive an order with a US military shipping address, then make sure that the address has been entered correctly before you ship the order. If the shipping address hasn't been entered correctly by the customer, then [edit the customer address](/en/manual/customers/manage-customers#edit-customer-profiles) using the following guidelines:

- The recipient's name must be entered into the **Name** boxes, but their rank is optional.
- For APO addresses, both the PSC and BOX numbers must be in the **Address** field.
- For FPO and DPO addresses, both the UNIT and BOX numbers must be in the **Address** field.
- The **City** field must contain only APO, FPO, or DPO. Don't enter the name of the city.
- **United States** must be selected in the **Country/region** field.
- **Armed Forces Americas**, **Armed Forces Europe**, or **Armed Forces Pacific** must be selected in the **State** field. These locations might be entered in abbreviated form by your customer as AA (Armed Forces America), AE (Armed Forces Europe), or AP (Armed Forces Pacific).

If you're not sure about some of the address information, then contact the customer who placed the order for further clarification.
